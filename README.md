-------About Virtual File System

In this project we emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to manage File system oriented tasks

As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage In this project we create a data structures which required for Rie Subsystems as Inade Inode Table, File Table UAREA, User File Descriptor Table, Super block, Disk Inode List Block, Data Block, Bout Block etc.

We provide all implementations of recessary system calls and commands of Fe subsystem as Oper, Close, Read, Write, Leek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fatat etc.

While providing the implementations of at above functionality we use our own data structures by referring Algorithms of UNNIX operating system 

 By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform
